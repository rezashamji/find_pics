# find_pics: measured results on a public test library (2026-10-02)

All numbers come from runs logged in [JOURNAL.md](../JOURNAL.md). Each states its denominator. Each "looked at" note
means the contact sheet was viewed image by image, not summarized by a script.

## Test library
19,218 items: 15,000 Open Images photos (human-verified labels for 15 concepts), about 4,100 IMDB scene photos
(6 "family members" photographed across 32-39 years each), and 120 Pexels videos.
- To mimic Apple's People album, only the clearest 50% of each person's photos carry a "tag". The job is to find the rest.
- Labels are imperfect. IMDB names one person per photo, and Open Images verified bread only on some images.
  Several "errors" below turned out to be label errors when I looked at them.

Indexing on one A100-40GB GPU per shard: about 23 image units per second (faces + image vector). The library took
113 s on 8 GPUs. 20,457 units (videos contribute several frames each), 22,955 faces, 0 decode errors.

## 1. Why "bread" search fails in Apple-style systems (fast stage only)
Apple-style search gives each photo a tag only when its score clears a fixed cutoff tuned for precision. We simulated
that: the cutoff with the highest recall that still has ≥90% precision on verified bread / not-bread images.

| encoder | bread recall at that cutoff | bread in top 264 | bread in top 1,320 (5×) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SigLIP2-so400m | 0.31 | 0.64 | 0.98 |
| PE-Core-L14-336 | 0.28 | 0.64 | 0.98 |

Denominator: 264 verified bread photos. A precision-tuned cutoff throws away about 70% of the bread. Ranking
everything and letting a judge check the top recovers it.

PE-Core matched or beat SigLIP2 at top-5× on most of the 15 concepts (sandwich 0.97 vs 0.58, guitar 0.97 vs 0.84, cake
0.99 vs 0.91) and became the default.

## 2. Person matching (face vectors)
Reference faces come from the tagged half; the targets are the untagged half.

| person (photo span) | untagged | found at sim ≥ 0.40 | wrong items added |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nicolas Cage (1975-2014) | 235 | 0.94 | 11 |
| Dan Aykroyd | 56 | 0.88 | 5 |
| Kim Basinger | 50 | 0.90 | 4 |
| Pierce Brosnan | 186 | 0.98 | 0 |
| Kevin Bacon | 168 | 0.96 | 1 |
| Drew Barrymore (1982-2014) | 245 | 0.93 | 0 |

These numbers are after the reference-contamination fix. Looked at: before the fix, Drew's 14 "wrong" matches were
Hugh Grant, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz. They are co-stars in tagged photos where her own face wasn't detected, so their
faces became "Drew" references. Misses were profile views, tiny faces, a childhood poster, old-age makeup, and a cartoon.

## 3. Full pipeline vs known answers (judge = Qwen3.5-9B on GPU; shipped settings, run 49840354)
| query | true matches | returned | recall vs labels | stated lower bound (95%) | bound held? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bread | 264 | 459 | 0.811 | 0.705 | yes |
| dog | 1,586 | 1,614 | 0.984 | 0.979 | yes |
| Kevin Bacon (all) | 336 | 329 (1 wrong) | 0.976 | not certified* | (+14 "possible", 1 real) |
| Drew Barrymore (all) | 490 | 469 (0 wrong) | 0.957 | not certified* | (+19 "possible", 11 real) |
| Nicolas Cage 1995-2005 | 168 | 174 | 0.970 | not certified* | 11 "wrong" = all actually Cage (looked at) |

(The earlier run at judge cutoff 0.5 gave bread 0.852 / bound 0.844 and dog 0.987 / bound 0.958; both held.
Across all three full-pipeline runs tonight (bread and dog each time), the stated bound was at or below the truth in
6 of 6 results. That's a small denominator; the 300-run simulation in section 4 is the larger check.)

*The VLM cannot recognize faces. On "is the person on the left the same as in this photo?" it said yes 191 times for
Kevin Bacon, and 4 of those were correct. So identity comes only from face vectors, and person completeness is reported
as the measured test-library rate plus a human review sample, never as a machine-certified bound.

Looked at, bread: in a random 36 of the 308 bread returns without a bread label, about 28 contain bread (burger buns,
sandwiches, toast), 3 are clear errors, and about 5 are pastry borderline cases.

## 4. Simulated certificate validity
On a simulated 150k library (2,000 true matches), the lower bound was at or below the true recall in 290 of 300 runs (96.7%).

## 5. "Looks overweight" judge vs CelebA "Chubby" labels (600 positive / 1,400 negative)
AUC (chance a random labeled-chubby face scores above a random other face): judge 0.896; fast text-image score 0.703.
Rate of judge "yes" on labeled-chubby / other faces at each P(yes) cutoff:

| cutoff | labeled chubby | other |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 239/600 | 22/1,400 |
| 0.3 | 339/600 | 63/1,400 |
| 0.2 | 409/600 | 122/1,400 |
| 0.1 | 486/600 | 249/1,400 |

Looked at: about 20 of the 24 most confident "labeled Chubby, judge says no" faces look lean to me, and most of them
appear to be Black men and women. That suggests the CelebA label itself is noisy and skewed. The judge also confuses
age with weight: its average P(yes) on not-chubby older faces is 0.166, vs 0.043 for young faces.

## 6. Within-person ranking (the transformation-video question)
132 CelebA people with ≥2 "Chubby" and ≥2 not-"Chubby" photos (2,707 photos). The question: within one person, does
the judge rank the chubby-labeled photos higher?
- "Does this person look overweight?": mean per-person AUC 0.642; above 0.5 for 94/132 people.
- "Does this person's face look heavier or fuller than average?": mean 0.660; above 0.5 for 104/132 people.

Looked at: for most people the two sets of photos look the same weight (the label is inconsistent), and the judge
sits near 0.5 on both. Where a visible change exists, the judge separates the eras (one person: 0.78-0.82 vs
0.47-0.56). That is thin evidence. Your own before/after photos are the real test.

## 7. Matching across eras (references from the recent era only)
This simulates the case where Apple tags only recent photos of you. References come from the newest half of each
person's tagged photos. "Early" is the oldest third of their photo years. Face similarity cutoff 0.40.

| person | recent-only: recall / early recall / wrong | + query-time expansion (0.55, 3 rounds) |
|---|---|---|
| Nicolas Cage | 0.91 / 0.88 / 11 | 0.95 / 0.95 / 11 |
| Dan Aykroyd | 0.87 / 0.80 / 5 | 0.91 / 0.90 / 5 |
| Kim Basinger | 0.89 / 0.83 / 4 | 0.92 / 0.86 / 4 |
| Pierce Brosnan | 0.97 / 0.96 / 0 | 0.99 / 0.98 / 0 |
| Kevin Bacon | 0.96 / 0.97 / 1 | 0.97 / 0.98 / 1 |
| Drew Barrymore | 0.91 / 0.92 / 0 | 0.95 / 0.98 / 0 |

Aging is tested here, not large weight change: none of these people had a dramatic one.

## 8. People no model has seen (DigiFace-1M: rendered identities that exist nowhere)
A face is in the training distribution as a category; a specific identity, like you, is not. 300 synthetic people,
72 images each, 8 used as references:
- at similarity ≥ 0.40: recall 18,855/19,110 (98.7%); per-person minimum 0.70, 10th percentile 0.97, median 1.00;
  44 wrong matches per person among 21,438 other-person images;
- at ≥ 0.30: recall 99.8%, but 955 wrong per person. That's why 0.30-0.40 is shown only as "possible".

## 9. Apple-format export, including videos (synthetic export built from public photos)
2,234 items in the exact osxphotos layout: 1,073 JPEG, 743 HEIC, 408 iCloud-preview JPEGs, 10 HEVC `.mov` videos.
0 decode errors. "Find every photo and video of Kevin Bacon":
- photos 317/324;
- **videos 4/4**, none of them tagged, so they were found only by face matching inside sampled frames;
- 0 of 6 other videos returned;
- 1 photo outside the labels, which looks like Bacon in a group shot (label noise).

## 10. Documented weight transformations (the closest public stand-in for your query)
People with published weight losses: Chris Pratt (lost 60 lb, 2013), Jonah Hill (about 40 lb, 2011), Seth Rogen (30 lb,
2009-10). IMDB-WIKI face crops, labeled by era. **The labels were badly contaminated:** of the "heavy-era" faces, 21/73
for Pratt, 9/47 for Hill and 21-22/46 for Rogen were other people (co-stars). I found this by looking at all 166.

**Face matching across the weight change, with references from the lean era only, counting only photos that are
really the person:** Pratt 51/52, Hill 37/38, Rogen 24/24 at similarity ≥ 0.40 (112/114). With the product's
cross-era expansion: 114/114. 0, 13 and 1 wrong matches among 5,997 other faces.

**The judge, heavier era vs lean era, verified photos only (AUC, where 0.5 = chance):** "face heavier/fuller" Pratt 0.857,
Hill 0.812, Rogen 0.869.

**Building the two albums (heavy-era photo in "heavier", lean-era in "fit"), totals over the 3 people:**

| rule | heavy-era → "heavier" | lean-era → "heavier" (leak) | lean-era → "fit" | heavy-era → "fit" (leak) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fixed cutoff + raw scores (old code) | 47/114 (Pratt 1/52) | 18/131 | 110/131 | 64/114 |
| rank within the person (shipped now) | 78/114 | 29/131 | 93/131 | 19/114 |

The judge's absolute scale differs by person, so only within-person ranking works. These numbers are by era; a photo
can look heavy in a "lean" year.
