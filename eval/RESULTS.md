# find_pics: measured results on a public test library (2026-10-02)

All numbers come from runs logged in [JOURNAL.md](../JOURNAL.md). Each states its denominator. Each "looked at" note
means the contact sheet was viewed image by image, not summarized by a script.

## Test library
19,218 items: 15,000 Open Images photos (human-verified labels for 15 concepts), about 4,100 IMDB scene photos
(6 "family members" photographed across 32-39 years each), and 120 Pexels videos.
- To mimic Apple's People album, only the clearest 50% of each person's photos carry a "tag". The job is to find the rest.
- Labels are imperfect. IMDB names one person per photo, and Open Images verified bread only on some images.
  Several "errors" below turned out to be label errors when I looked at them.

Indexing on one A100-40GB GPU per shard: about 23 image units per second (faces + image vector). The library took
113 s on 8 GPUs. 20,457 units (videos contribute several frames each), 22,955 faces, 0 decode errors.

## 1. Why "bread" search fails in Apple-style systems (fast stage only)
Apple-style search gives each photo a tag only when its score clears a fixed cutoff tuned for precision. We simulated
that: the cutoff with the highest recall that still has ≥90% precision on verified bread / not-bread images.

| encoder | bread recall at that cutoff | bread in top 264 | bread in top 1,320 (5×) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SigLIP2-so400m | 0.31 | 0.64 | 0.98 |
| PE-Core-L14-336 | 0.28 | 0.64 | 0.98 |

Denominator: 264 verified bread photos. A precision-tuned cutoff throws away about 70% of the bread. Ranking
everything and letting a judge check the top recovers it.

PE-Core matched or beat SigLIP2 at top-5× on most of the 15 concepts (sandwich 0.97 vs 0.58, guitar 0.97 vs 0.84, cake
0.99 vs 0.91) and became the default.

## 2. Person matching (face vectors)
Reference faces come from the tagged half; the targets are the untagged half.

| person (photo span) | untagged | found at sim ≥ 0.40 | wrong items added |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nicolas Cage (1975-2014) | 235 | 0.94 | 11 |
| Dan Aykroyd | 56 | 0.88 | 5 |
| Kim Basinger | 50 | 0.90 | 4 |
| Pierce Brosnan | 186 | 0.98 | 0 |
| Kevin Bacon | 168 | 0.96 | 1 |
| Drew Barrymore (1982-2014) | 245 | 0.93 | 0 |

These numbers are after the reference-contamination fix. Looked at: before the fix, Drew's 14 "wrong" matches were
Hugh Grant, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz. They are co-stars in tagged photos where her own face wasn't detected, so their
faces became "Drew" references. Misses were profile views, tiny faces, a childhood poster, old-age makeup, and a cartoon.

## 3. Full pipeline vs known answers (judge = Qwen3.5-9B on GPU)
| query | true matches | returned | recall vs labels | stated lower bound (95%) | bound held? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bread | 264 | 533 | 0.852 | 0.844 | yes |
| dog | 1,586 | 1,632 | 0.987 | 0.958 | yes |
| Kevin Bacon (all) | 336 | 329 (1 wrong) | 0.976 | not certified* | (+14 "possible", 1 real) |
| Drew Barrymore (all) | 490 | 469 (0 wrong) | 0.957 | not certified* | (+19 "possible", 11 real) |
| Nicolas Cage 1995-2005 | 168 | 174 | 0.970 | not certified* | 11 "wrong" = all actually Cage (looked at) |

*The VLM cannot recognize faces. On "is the person on the left the same as in this photo?" it said yes 191 times for
Kevin Bacon, and 4 of those were correct. So identity comes only from face vectors, and person completeness is reported
as the measured test-library rate plus a human review sample, never as a machine-certified bound.

Looked at, bread: in a random 36 of the 308 bread returns without a bread label, about 28 contain bread (burger buns,
sandwiches, toast), 3 are clear errors, and about 5 are pastry borderline cases.

## 4. Simulated certificate validity
On a simulated 150k library (2,000 true matches), the lower bound was at or below the true recall in 290 of 300 runs (96.7%).

## 5. "Looks overweight" judge vs CelebA "Chubby" labels (600 positive / 1,400 negative)
AUC (chance a random labeled-chubby face scores above a random other face): judge 0.896; fast text-image score 0.703.
Rate of judge "yes" on labeled-chubby / other faces at each P(yes) cutoff:

| cutoff | labeled chubby | other |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 239/600 | 22/1,400 |
| 0.3 | 339/600 | 63/1,400 |
| 0.2 | 409/600 | 122/1,400 |
| 0.1 | 486/600 | 249/1,400 |

Looked at: about 20 of the 24 most confident "labeled Chubby, judge says no" faces look lean to me, and most of them
appear to be Black men and women. That suggests the CelebA label itself is noisy and skewed. The judge also confuses
age with weight: its average P(yes) on not-chubby older faces is 0.166, vs 0.043 for young faces.
