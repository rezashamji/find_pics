# find_pics journal (append-only)

## 2026-10-02 00:47 — kickoff
- Task from Reza: overnight, research how Apple/Google find people and search photos, check what already exists,
  then build an open-source, local, read-only tool that answers natural-language photo queries (person + attribute +
  time), makes albums, and honestly reports scan counts and estimated completeness. Demo: Reza's weight-loss
  transformation albums ("heavier" vs "fit, last 6 months"), photos and videos.
- Environment found: running on holylogin07 (login node, no GPU). Slurm accounts kempner_mzitnik_lab, mzitnik_lab;
  partitions kempner_h100 / kempner_h200 / kempner_requeue / gpu_h200. git configured (rezashamji). GitHub SSH works
  (`ssh -T git@github.com` -> rezashamji) but no API token and no `gh`, so Claude cannot create the repo: asked Reza.
  HF logged in as rezashamji; existing HF_HOME is outside find_pics, so env.sh redirects HF_HOME inside and reads the
  token in place via HF_TOKEN_PATH. Lab quota: 84.5T / 120T used, fine.
- Reza (mid-turn): no iCloud password needed if another method works; test first on public images/videos; must be
  read-only, never delete. Decision: Mac-side osxphotos export (read-only) + rsync to data/private (chmod 700);
  public ground-truth test library built in parallel so nothing blocks on the upload.
- Verified osxphotos flags from official docs (rhettbull.github.io/osxphotos/cli.html): --sidecar json,
  --convert-to-jpeg, --jpeg-quality, --skip-edited, --only-photos/--only-movies, --preview-if-missing, --update,
  --ramdb, --filename, --person, --post-command CATEGORY "TEMPLATE" with {filepath|shell_quote}. No built-in resize
  -> use macOS `sips -Z` in --post-command.
- Launched 4 background research agents -> research/01..04.
- Wrote env.sh, .gitignore, CLAUDE.md (resume protocol + hard rules), PLAN.md.

## ~00:58 — loop armed, P2 started
- Dynamic /loop armed (self-paced wake-ups). Research agents running (02 competition agent still finishing its own background work).
- P2: scripts/setup_env.sh building envs/fp (uv, Python 3.12, torch cu128, transformers, open_clip, insightface,
  onnxruntime-gpu, pillow-heif, av, hdbscan...). Log: slurm/logs/setup_env.log.
- Asked Reza for: Mac export+upload (docs/MAC_EXPORT.md), empty private GitHub repo rezashamji/find_pics, privacy OK.

## ~01:05 — env fix, public test data
- Bug: env.sh ended with `[ -f activate ] && source` -> exit status 1 when env absent -> setup_env.sh (set -e) died
  silently with an empty log. Fixed to an if-statement. Env rebuild running.
- First `nohup ... &` launch was killed when its shell exited; long tasks now run as tracked background tasks.
- Public test library sources (decided):
  - IMDB full scene photos (systemk-ai/imdb-wiki, config imdb): person name + photo year + face box. Real scenes
    across years ~ stand-in for a family library. Known caveat: IMDB-WIKI name labels are noisy (the labeled face is
    the largest face; can be the wrong person). Must audit before trusting as ground truth. 14 shards downloaded.
  - CelebA test split (flwrlabs/celeba): clean identities + "Chubby"/"Double_Chin" attributes (heavy-looking ground truth). Aligned crops, so easier than real life.
  - Open Images V7 validation: human-verified image labels. 15,000 images selected = all 5,498 with verified labels
    for 15 concepts (Bread 264 pos, Baked goods 800, Cake 275, Dog 1586, ...) + random filler. Bread prevalence ~1.8%.
    Recall is measured against verified positives only (unverified images may also contain bread; precision is audited by eye).
  - Pexels videos (minh132/pexels-videos, 523 clips) for video handling.
- Gotcha: `hf download --include A B C` silently ignored the first pattern; use one --include per pattern.

## 01:10 — competition verdict (research/02), env retry
- research/02_competition_landscape.md landed. Key facts (agent-sourced, cited in file):
  - NL photo search incl. person+attribute is already shipped: Apple Photos iOS 18.1+ (on-device, Apple Intelligence devices),
    Google Ask Photos (cloud). Open source: Immich v3.2 (2026-09) combines person AND CLIP text AND date AND media type;
    but filters are set by hand (no sentence parsing), no cutoff/recall, one frame per video, no Apple Photos write-back.
  - osxphotos (MIT) already reads Apple people/labels/captions and can create albums (--add-to-album).
  - No product/repo/paper found that reports items scanned + recall estimate with an interval. Incumbents publicly weak on
    recall (Google paused Ask Photos June 2025 citing recall; Ente code comment: fixed threshold "trades recall").
  - Recall-certification statistics exist in DB/e-discovery (SUPG, BARGAIN, PPI, QBCB, Callaghan & Mueller-Hansen) but not applied to photos.
  - Closest research: "Personal AI Agent for Camera Roll VQA" arXiv 2606.05275 (Gemini/GPT based, no face model).
  - License traps: InsightFace buffalo_l/antelopev2 and Apple MobileCLIP weights are non-commercial. SigLIP2, Qwen3-VL/Qwen3.5 Apache-2.0.
- DECISION (Feynman check passed only for a narrow wedge): do NOT build "another photo search app". Build an *auditable*
  retrieval layer: sentence -> plan, person+attribute+time, multi-frame video, VLM verification, and a scan count + recall
  interval that says what it is relative to (judge vs user labels), writing albums to Apple Photos via osxphotos.
- Env: torch download from download.pytorch.org crawled at ~170 KB/s -> switched to PyPI wheels. My pkill pattern matched its
  own shell (exit 144) - lesson: use pgrep -f with a narrower pattern / kill by PID.
- Open Images 15,000/15,000 downloaded. IMDB 14 shards, CelebA test 3 shards, Pexels 523 videos (7.2 GB) downloaded.

## 01:13 — research/01 Apple/Google internals landed
- Apple People (Apple ML Research 2021, still the only public description): face + upper-body detector, separate face and
  body embedding nets, two-pass clustering: pass 1 strict ("high precision but many, smaller clusters"), clothing only
  compared within a time/place moment; pass 2 merges across moments using faces only. New faces assigned by matching
  against multiple stored exemplars per person. Clustering "typically overnight during device charging"; assignment of a new
  face to a known person happens near capture. No embedding dims/thresholds published. => Reza's guess "VLM" was wrong:
  it's embeddings + clustering, not a VLM.
- Why People misses (documented): strict first pass, unclear faces filtered out, clothing cues only within a moment,
  only frequent people promoted; "Review More Photos" = candidates it holds but won't auto-apply. Research: accuracy drops
  with profile, age gap, small/occluded faces.
- Classic Apple search: fixed taxonomy (Vision has 1,303 labels incl. "bread" per a third-party dump), per-label thresholds,
  synonym + word-embedding fallback. So "bread" misses = score below bread's cutoff / index unfinished / no Apple Intelligence.
  Apple NL search (iOS 18.1+, iPhone 15 Pro+): model undocumented.
- Google Ask Photos since June 2025: classic results first, then Gemini narrows candidates -> cannot find what the first
  stage missed (inference). Samsung S25: on-device VLM search.
- No product reports completeness. (Absence of evidence in reviewed docs.)
- Rule breach by research agent 01: briefly downloaded PDFs to the session /tmp scratchpad, deleted afterwards. Noted.

## ~01:16 — research/03 models landed; stack decisions
- Report recommendations: SCRFD det (run >=1280px for small faces); identity: CVLface AdaFace ViT-B KPRPE WebFace12M
  (best cross-age AgeDB-30 98.1, CPLFW 95.65, TinyFace 76.1); text-image: facebook/PE-Core-L14-336 (Apache-2.0, COCO t2i 57.1)
  + crops/tags for small objects like bread; verifier Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B P(yes), thinking off, images <=~1MP; reranker
  Qwen3-VL-Reranker-2B; parser Qwen3.5-4B; Mac: 4-bit Qwen3.5-2B/4B via mlx-vlm, index computed elsewhere or on-device.
- Weight change: no modern study of face embeddings across large weight change; only pre-2015 work showing severe drops.
  => must MEASURE on Reza's own before/after photos (Apple's tags give pairs across years).
- Body-weight from photos: absolute BMI error 2.3-4; VLMs show weight bias. Only a relative, per-person trend is realistic.
- License: InsightFace weights (buffalo_l, antelopev2, SCRFD) non-commercial; Apple MobileCLIP/DFN/FastVLM research-only;
  MetaCLIP 2, jina-clip-v2 CC-BY-NC; CVLface no license (research data). Commercial-safe swaps: SCRFD-34G v2 MIT
  (immich-app/scrfd_34g_gnkps) or YuNet; AuraFace recognizer (Apache-2.0); PE-Core / SigLIP2; Qwen3.5 / Gemma 4 (Apache-2.0).
- DECISIONS for tonight (personal-use build; license notes in README):
  1. faces: InsightFace buffalo_l first (fast to integrate); evaluate cross-year matching on IMDB; swap/compare AdaFace if time.
  2. image vectors: benchmark PE-Core-L14-336 vs SigLIP2-so400m on the Open Images concept set; pick by recall@k with denominators.
  3. judge + planner: Qwen3.5-9B via vLLM.
