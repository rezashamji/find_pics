# find_pics journal (append-only)

## 2026-10-02 00:47 — kickoff
- Task from Reza: overnight, research how Apple/Google find people and search photos, check what already exists,
  then build an open-source, local, read-only tool that answers natural-language photo queries (person + attribute +
  time), makes albums, and honestly reports scan counts and estimated completeness. Demo: Reza's weight-loss
  transformation albums ("heavier" vs "fit, last 6 months"), photos and videos.
- Environment found: running on holylogin07 (login node, no GPU). Slurm accounts kempner_mzitnik_lab, mzitnik_lab;
  partitions kempner_h100 / kempner_h200 / kempner_requeue / gpu_h200. git configured (rezashamji). GitHub SSH works
  (`ssh -T git@github.com` -> rezashamji) but no API token and no `gh`, so Claude cannot create the repo: asked Reza.
  HF logged in as rezashamji; existing HF_HOME is outside find_pics, so env.sh redirects HF_HOME inside and reads the
  token in place via HF_TOKEN_PATH. Lab quota: 84.5T / 120T used, fine.
- Reza (mid-turn): no iCloud password needed if another method works; test first on public images/videos; must be
  read-only, never delete. Decision: Mac-side osxphotos export (read-only) + rsync to data/private (chmod 700);
  public ground-truth test library built in parallel so nothing blocks on the upload.
- Verified osxphotos flags from official docs (rhettbull.github.io/osxphotos/cli.html): --sidecar json,
  --convert-to-jpeg, --jpeg-quality, --skip-edited, --only-photos/--only-movies, --preview-if-missing, --update,
  --ramdb, --filename, --person, --post-command CATEGORY "TEMPLATE" with {filepath|shell_quote}. No built-in resize
  -> use macOS `sips -Z` in --post-command.
- Launched 4 background research agents -> research/01..04.
- Wrote env.sh, .gitignore, CLAUDE.md (resume protocol + hard rules), PLAN.md.
